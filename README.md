# Overview
A research project with a PhD Candidate at WashU's Visual Data Analytics Lab, involving predicting the existence of common nutrients in a food given its ingredients list.

- Used language processing to convert the ingredients lists to numerical vectors (input), along with USDA nutrient data (ground-truth output), to train a multilabel classifier model
- Worked with TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn
